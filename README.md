# Creative Bakery landing page

Creative Bakery landing page - [DEMO LINK](https://tania-troshchuk.github.io/layout_creativeBakery/).

Creative Bakery landing page - this is one of my works, which I performed using knowledge of HTML, CSS, SASS, BEM, and JavaScript. The landing page was developed by implementing an adaptive layout (using a grid and flexbox).

The landing page is intuitive and easy for the user to interact with the product so that the user can easily place an order without any complications.

This landing was developed according to the layout [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/dY3izAm0Vspsmra4lQWQIP/Bakerlab-FE-students?node-id=0%3A1).

This landing page was designed according to the layout for such devices as:
- phone (with a screen width of more than 320 pixels);
- tablet (with screen width from 768 pixels to 1200 pixels);
- notebook (with screen width from 1200 pixels to 1440 pixels);
- large monitors (with a screen width of more than 1440 pixels).
